This is my final project for the class [Phys-41 - Scientific Computing with Python](https://catalog.ucsd.edu/courses/PHYS.html). 

![UCSD School of Physical Sciences Course Catalog](<Phys-41 UCSD Course Description.png>)

It is a game in which the player attempts to guess a randomly generated sequence of colors within a set number of attempts.

Use [Final Project.ipynb](<Final Project.ipynb>) to import this project in a Jupyter Notebook. 
This file also provides detailed explanation about the process of writing the code for this game. 

Use [ColorGuessingGame.py](<ColorGuessingGame.py>) to execute the game from other Python IDEs (Integrated Development Environments), such as Thonny. 


I have used: 
- NumPy library
- Matplotlib library
- Markdown  
- Jupyter Notebook 6.4.8 on Ubuntu 22.04.2 desktop

For other Python exercises I have used:
- SciPy
- Healpy
- Astropy
- Google Colab Notebook
